  getmeta - CLI for querying and displaying GoodData report defns and other metadata
  The data returned is needed for executing the 'rptexport' script.

  The recommended usage is the following sequence of commands:
  getmeta list -u <user> -p <pswd> -w <wrkspc_id> -t reports
    to list all reports and their ID; note the ID of the report you want to run;
    it will be used in the next command
  getmeta get -u <user> -p <pswd> -w <wrkspc_id> --type report --object <obj_id>
    to get the report definitions for your report; normally you want the latest
    definition, which is normally listed first and has the highest ID number
  getmeta get -u <user> -p <pswd> -w <wrkspc_id> --type rptdefn --object <obj_id>
    to get the report definition and list of attributeDisplayForms; the latter are uses
    of attributes and you will need any of those that you wish to use in dynamic
    filters when the report is executed; for list-type filters, you will also need to
    note the attribute ID (printed at the end of each line) and use it in the next step
  getmeta get -u <user> -p <pswd> -w <wrkspc_id> --type attribForm --object <obj_id>
    (optional) to get the list of values that can be used in a 'list' filter; run this
    for each attributeDisplayForm upon which you will have a list filter; note the
    element ID(s) of any values (shown in brackets) that will be in the list of values

  Armed with the required IDs noted above, you can now create a command-line to run the
  'rptexport' script.

  NOTE: the GoodData gray pages can also get this data although not as conveniently.

  Usage: see getmeta --help
